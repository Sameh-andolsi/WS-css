          the city of Senbellawein, Dakahlia Governorate, <br> in the Nile Delta  to a
          family with a religious background <br> as her fatherIbrahim El-Sayyid 
          El-Beltagi was an imam <br>from the Egyptian countryside,her mother was
          Fatmah <br> El-Maleegi, a housewife.She learned how to sing by <br>listening to
          her father teach her older brother, Khalid.<br> From a young age, she
          showed exceptional singing talent.<br> Through her father, she learned to
          recite the Qur'an,<br> and she reportedly memorized the entire book. Her<br>
          grandfather was also a well known reader of the Quran <br>and she
          remembered how the villagers used to listen to him<br> when he recited the
          Qu'ran.When she was 12 years old,<br> having noticed her strength in
          singing, her father asked her<br> to join the family ensemble, upon which
          she joined as a <br> supporting voice, at the beginning just repeating what
          the<br> others sang.

        <p>
          Amin El Mahdi invited her into the cultural circles in Cairo.<br> In 1924,
          she was introduced to the poet Ahmed Rami,<br> who was to write 137
          songs for her and also introduced her<br> to French literature eventually
          becoming her head mentor in<br> Arabic literature and literary analysis.
          In 1926, she left <br> Odeon records for Gramophone records who would pay
          her <br> about double per record and even an additional $10,000 salary. <br>
          She also maintained a tightly managed public image, which <br> undoubtedly
          added to her allure. Furthermore, she was <br> introduced to the renowned
          oud virtuoso and composer <br> Mohamed El Qasabgi, who introduced her to
          the Arabic Theatre <br> Palace, where she would experience her first real
          public success.<br> Other musicians who influenced her musical
          performances at the <br> time were Dawwod Hosni or Abu al-IlaMuhammad
          . <br>Al-Ila Muhammad instructed her in the control over her
          voice,<br> and variants of the Arabic Muwashshah.By 1930, she was so
          well<br> known to the public, that she was the example to follow for
          several<br> young female singers. In 1932, she embarked upon a major
          tour of  <br>the Middle East and North Africa, performing in prominent Arab<br>
          capital cities such as Damascus, Baghdad, Beirut, Rabat, Tunis, and
          finally Tripoli.
